    <h4>Childhood</h4>
    <p>I grew up in Eagle, Idaho on "the farm", a big white farmhouse with a small alfalfa field and a big garden. 
    My parents were both engineers, but loved the countryside so the farm was more for fun than anything else. 
    The property was huge for the four of us; we had a butterfly garden, a big playset, an orchard, a greenhouse, and a big 
    treehouse in the alfalfa field. My dad barbequed on the deck, my mom forced me and my sister to learn how to garden, 
    and my sister and I played old video games. When I was about 9, we moved across the city to be closer to school.

    <h4>School</h4>
    <p>I briefly attended some pre-school in Eagle that tried to teach me Spanish, but the other 13 years of my pre-college 
    education were spent at Riverstone [International] School, which is currently run by the lovely man leaning on the sign 
    in the picture. From kindergarten through senior year, I was a permanent fixture at the school. It's grown a lot in my 
    time there, but I still graduated in a class of 22 students, with 4 classmates that had also been there since 
    kindergarten. We were the first class to complete the MYP (pre-IB) program, and we went on to complete the IB program in 
    high school.

    <h4>College</h4>
    <p>I applied to Tufts University (and 7 other schools), and they let me in for some reason, so I packed up and left 
    for Boston. I met my two best friends in the first two weeks, and started on my CS degree. Two years later, I'm living 
    with my friends and still working on the degree, but I've added a math minor. This summer, I'm taking a CS class and 
    then as soon as it's over, I'm out of here to spend a week in on the beach Greece before school starts again. I've also 
    become addicted to Union Square doughnuts. You should check them out.
